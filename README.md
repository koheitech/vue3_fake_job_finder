# Job Finder
This is Vue3-based application written in TypeScript,
which is based on the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfI5PISLr9w&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gCtAuEdXTjNVE5bbMFo5OD&index=1) by The Net Ninja.

It does not have backend and hence CRUD feature since it is purely for study of Vue3 & TS,
but it has sorting feature of the content:
- sort by features
    - sort by title
    - sort by salary
    - sort by location
- reverse the order (ASC, DESC)
